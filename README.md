# FatCMS Acumen 
* Version: 2.0.0 This is the first public version. 1.0.0 was a test version.

## Description

FatCMS is a CMS built using the CodeIgniter PHP framework. Using an MVC architecture
it was built with modularity in mind. Lightweight, themeable and dynamic.

FatCMS Acumen is free to use, redistribute and/or modify for any purpose whether personal or commercial however you must retain the copyright in your source code and in the footer of the administration.

## Installation

Run http://example.com/installer to run the web-based installation script.

## Upgrading

* There is not anything to upgrade to. When new versions come out there will be instructions in the readme.md on how to upgrade.

## Security

If you notice any sort of bug or issue relating to security, please report this to `DFridman29@gmail.com`. Posting an issue
or writing an article containing this information could have serious effects on the FatCMS community at large and is a
wreckless thing to do. We will get a patch out within 24 hours and recommend the community upgrades, to help minimise the
impact any security issue may have.

## Git Structure

We use the git-flow model to structure our branches. This means you won't see a lot of activity on the master branch besides releases.
Most of the magic happens in the develop branch.

It's strongly recommended that you download the [git-flow client](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and "publish" each feature branch you would like to see merged into the core. This way all features are not version-dependant and you can make as many changes as you like without needing them all to be merged in order.

## Thanks

### This is a fork of PyroCMS.
